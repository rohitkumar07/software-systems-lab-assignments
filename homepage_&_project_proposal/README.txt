- I declare that all work for this lab (my personal webpage)  is my own work and I have not plagiarized any code or any  
  significant part of it. My group page, the lab project demonstration page and the design done in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
  has a major contribution of mine.

  The resources that I have referred to for learning stuffs include:
  1. W3Schools (http://www.w3schools.com/html/)
  2. Codeacademy (for HTML and CSS videos)
  3. Youtube for searching project ideas
  5. Inkscape basic tutorial and Box-2D webs
  4. Last but not the least, Google!
